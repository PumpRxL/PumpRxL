# Solana Trading Bot

## Overview
This is a comprehensive Solana trading bot that includes modules for wallet management, buying and selling, and interacting with Pump.fun. The bot is designed to be modular, allowing users to easily select and execute different functionalities.

## Features and Modules

### Wallet Manager Module
- **Primary Wallet Creator**: Create a primary wallet to hold and distribute funds.
- **Automated Wallet Generator**: Generate a specified number of Solana wallets automatically.
- **Automated SOL Distribution**: Distribute SOL from the primary wallet to newly generated wallets for order execution.

### Buy and Sell Module
- **Perpetual Buy and Sell Orders**: Execute simultaneous buy and sell orders using the wallets generated by the automated wallets generator feature. Ensures more buy orders than sell orders, with total token sold equal to total token bought. Funds are returned to the primary wallet, and the process repeats every 30 seconds.
- **Dump All**: Sells all held tokens and returns SOL to the primary wallet when `CTRL+D` is pressed.
- **Holders Amount Boost**: Executes micro buys and holds using multiple wallets to give the impression of an increased holders count.

### Pump Fun Module
- **Token Creation**: Creates a basic token on Pump.fun.
- **Pump.fun Bundle Launcher**: Buys a predefined amount of the same token it creates on Pump.fun simultaneously with the token launch, using the wallets generated by the automated wallets generator feature.
- **Dump All**: Sells all held tokens and returns SOL to the primary wallet when `CTRL+D` is pressed.
